Task d.
    a. With the data that you have, what data vis graph should be used?
    I think we should have two line graphs, one showing the average temperature 
    (15 minute - daily average) and one of the humidity. They are simple, and
    effective for long term weather data we're displaying.

    b. What should be represented in the above graph? Why?
    Temperature/Date, and Humidity/Date. That data graphed will produce a
    clean graph, showing the temperature and humidity over a large amount of
    time. This is best suited as it is a constant data source being summarised
    into an average. (Analog real world temperature into digital temperature 
    value)

    c. Python supports numerous data vis libraries, which two did you pick?
    We picked matplotlib and plot.ly, as they are the two most popular graphing
    libraries.
