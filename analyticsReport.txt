Task d.
    a. With the data that you have, what data vis graph should be used?
    I think we should have two line graphs, one showing the average temperature 
    (daily average) and one of the humidity. They are simple, and effective for 
    long term weather data we're displaying.

    b. What should be represented in the above graph? Why?
    Temperature/Date, and Humidity/Date. That data graphed will produce a
    clean graph, showing the temperature and humidity over a large amount of
    time. This is best suited as it is a constant data source being summarised
    into an average. (Analog real world temperature into digital temperature 
    value)

    c. Python supports numerous data vis libraries, which two did you pick?
    We picked matplotlib and Seaborn, as they are the two most popular graphing
    libraries, as the most popular, they are also the most stable, which
    generally means better performance, and better reliabilty, which is
    important on embedded devices such as Internet of Things devices.


    d. comparison of libraries used
    At the low level of what we were doing, (creating a single graph, with 
    one dataset) it is clear that matplotlib is the better option for creating
    graphs in python. For the more advanced graphs, matplotlib is not as
    efficient as Seaborn. While seaborn is slower and more 'simple' which is
    pointless when creating a incredibly simple graph.
